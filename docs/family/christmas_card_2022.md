# Christmas Card 2022
*The following letter was written by a robot:* 

Dear Friends and Family,

We hope this Christmas letter finds you all well and ready to hear about all the exciting (and sometimes crazy) adventures of the Lockwitz family.  

First and foremost, we have some big news to share - we welcomed a new little bundle of joy into our family in January. Baby Evvy has been keeping us on our toes and making us laugh every day. She's even managed to train Gattaca, our bernedoodle dog, to fetch diapers and wipes when she needs a change (we're still working on getting her to do the laundry).

We've traveled far and wide this year, from Santa Barbara to Minnesota for sip and see parties to introduce Evvy to our extended family and friends. In June, Evvy started daycare at Montessori Academy of Colorado, which is only a two-block walk from our house. She's been having a blast and we've been getting some much-needed rest (well, as much rest as you can get with a toddler).

In July, we took a family vacation to Charleston and got to go in the ocean for the first time. It was a memorable trip and we can't wait to go back one day (or maybe just stick to the pool next time). On the work front, Christina started a new job as a Nurse Practitioner at Rocky Mountain Senior Care and has been loving it. Michael is going on his third year as an Engineering Manager at Dispatch and has been working hard to turn on a new logistics system (we're pretty sure he's secretly a robot).

We've been on the hunt for a new house in the northern suburbs to get more space, but have not quite found the right one yet. We have submitted a few offers, but are still on the lookout (we're starting to think we're just too picky). Unfortunately, we have all been getting sick a lot lately, but we are trying to stay healthy and take care of ourselves (mostly by relying on copious amounts of Netflix and chicken soup). In March, we traveled to Florida to meet some cousins and grandparents and Evvy had her first flight (she slept through the entire thing, of course). We also had the opportunity to meet cousin Ian from South Korea, who is now our official kimchi taste tester (he's a tough critic).

Overall, it has been a busy but fulfilling year for the Lockwitz family. We hope you have had a great year as well and we look forward to seeing you all during the holiday season.

Warm wishes (and lots of love),
The Lockwitz Family
