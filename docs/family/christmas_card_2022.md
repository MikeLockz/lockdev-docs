# Christmas Card 2022

Dear Friends and Family,

We hope this letter finds you well as we approach the end of another year. The Lockwitz family has had a busy and exciting year, filled with many memorable moments.

First and foremost, we welcomed a new addition to our family in January - baby Evvy! She has brought so much joy and love into our lives, and we can't imagine life without her. She has been a great sleeper and an easy baby, and we are so grateful for that.

Our bernedoodle, Gattaca, has also been a constant source of joy this year. While she can be a handful at times and still needs a lot of walks, we love her dearly.

We had the opportunity to travel to both Santa Barbara and Minnesota for sip and see parties for Evvy, and it was so nice to see extended family and friends.

Evvy started daycare at the Montessori Academy of Colorado this year, which is located just two blocks from our house. It has been a great experience for her, and we love the convenience of being able to walk to drop her off and pick her up.

We had the Lockwitz family vacation over summer in Charleston, where we got to experience the beauty of the ocean for Evvy's first time. It was a wonderful trip, and we hope to do it again someday.

In other news, Christina started a new job as a Nurse Practitioner at Rocky Mountain Senior Care, and she is loving it so far. Michael is going into his third year now as an Engineering Manager at Dispatch where he helped turn on a new logistics system.

We have been looking for a new house this past year, with a few offers submitted on houses in the northern suburbs. We are still searching for the right one, but we are hopeful that we will find it soon.

Overall, it has been a great year for the Lockwitz family, and we are looking forward to making more memories in the year to come.

Wishing you all a fantastic 2023.

Sincerely, The Lockwitz Family
